# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before running any `npm` or `yarn` command, we need to run the `node` with version `18.10.0` and I suggest you to use `nvm (Node Version Manager)` to easily switch the node version. You can see the installation guide in [NVM official repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Once you've installed NVM, you can switch to required version by typing

```bash
$ nvm use
```

It will automatically switch to `Node version 18.10.0` and then you can install all dependencies with command

```bash
# if you use yarn
$ yarn install
```

or

```bash
# if you use npm
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# if you use yarn

# development
$ yarn start
```

or

```bash
# if you use npm

# development
$ npm run start
```
